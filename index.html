          <p>The data displayed above illustrates that in states with higher poverty rates, there are also more citizens without healthcare.
            The causation behind this correlation could be informed by many different factors. I believe it is most likely that our current, entirely privatized healthcare system's high monthly premiums and soaring deductables do not present a viable option for individuals of low socioeconomic status (low-SES), and certainly not for those who are classified as impoverished.
            They may view the current options as worse than the reality of living uninsured, or simply may not be able to pay any available premium, despite wanting converage.</p>
            
          <p>One can see that the impoverished individual without healthcare coverage is also much more likely to need costly medical care over time (no regular doctor's visits, a poor diet, perhaps an unsafe working environment, etc).
            Lacking health insurance forces those individuals to accrue medical debt at much higher rates than those who are insured (what with paying the full cost of any medications or procedures necessary). This conveniently traps these individuals in a cycle of continued poverty, which they are less and less likely to escape as our time without universal healthcare drags on. </p>
